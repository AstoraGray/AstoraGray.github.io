​	The supreme will determined the existence of the world, which was divided into Eden, the human realm, and hell. The supreme will created a chess game called TIGI, which became the highest stake. In the near future, the first war in the world broke out in Eden, a battle between gods. Eventually, two ancient gods survived the conflict, locked in a stalemate. They decided to determine the winner through TIGI. In the end, one god gained control of the human realm and became God, while the other was expelled to hell and became the Devil. The Devil's TIGI was far inferior to that of God, but he prophesied that one day a human would defeat God with astonishing chess skills. Thus, the Devil and God made a wager: if God lost, the Devil would take control of the human realm, and God would be cast into hell.

God and the Devil brought the game of TIGI to the human realm, and thus humanity came to possess this game. Initially, in primitive society, people used stones and sticks to represent the existence of the Heavenly Tower, which symbolized the supreme power, representing both the divine and the demonic. In the Middle Ages, people used crosses and tridents to signify the Heavenly Tower; now, human technology has advanced to the point where physical representations of the Heavenly Tower exist. The TIGI game replaced warfare, with the pieces on the board representing individual lives.

As evolution continued, finally, one person stood before God and challenged him to a game of TIGI. Ultimately, God lost the game. At that moment, the Devil appeared and expelled God's soul to hell, while this human was also cast into hell. The Devil took control of the human realm; although its appearance did not change to that of hell, human nature gradually twisted.

Bound and restrained, God was unable to act. This human took on God's will and, through the game of TIGI in hell, defeated one demon after another. Eventually, he returned to the human realm and challenged the Devil. At the final chessboard, the Devil lost the match. This human then gained the power to take over both the human realm and hell, but he chose to relinquish it. This era belonged to humanity, and humanity would eventually reach for the stars and the sea. In the end, an era belonging to humanity was born.
