​	Recently, my life has been quite mundane, yet it has been spiraling upwards like fireworks. I have made an effort to adhere to the three rules I set for myself: do my work well, rest properly, and learn Japanese diligently. At work, I have overcome many difficulties. The development of VisionPro has been challenging due to its closed-source nature and partially open API; many functionalities felt like a black box during the development process, requiring numerous tests to draw conclusions and patterns. The best approach has been to inquire with the Polyspatial team on the Unity forums, but there are times when they don’t know the answers, choosing not to respond at all. This development model has allowed me to navigate flexibly between Discord, GitHub, and Unity Discussions, enhancing my technical problem-solving skills. As for VisionPro, I believe I should be able to handle it now.

​	Regarding resting well, I admit I haven't been 100% compliant recently. For instance, I’ve been going to bed around three or four in the morning and waking up at nine-thirty, which is a bit of a challenge for my physical limits, leaving me a bit dazed. So, starting from today—after finishing this article—I plan to sleep early. When it comes to learning Japanese, I now memorize 20 to 30 words daily, which is one of the most efficient intervals for my memory retention. I recently reviewed the N5 vocabulary and realized I can understand most of it, although I haven’t learned much grammar yet. However, having a solid vocabulary is definitely foundational, and memorizing words is never a wrong move! One of my favorite phrases in Japanese is from the beginning of the novel "Kaze ni Naru" (起风了), which is "それから夏の日々". I love it both for its pronunciation and meaning. It opens the novel with the sense of summer—the season of growth. This phrase oddly reminds me of Jun Maeda’s work "Natsukage". It holds great significance to me.

​	On another note, my RimeFramework is now 80% complete. While developing this framework, I didn’t just write code blindly; instead, I created the smallest use cases for each module to validate their usability and effectiveness. So far, I am very satisfied with RimeFramework, and I have a feeling it will play an important role in my future independent projects. As for refining it, participating in more Game Jams is the way to go. It is a growth-oriented framework, and I hope to enhance it to the point where it can support the development of any game.

​	Lastly, there’s something worth noting: I seem to have developed a new interest in film photography. I find the process fascinating, and the texture of film has more collectible value than modern cameras. If only I could use a Nikon F1 to photograph the rivers of Martian canyons and the Martian atmosphere; I hope to have that opportunity in the future. I believe that the emergence of ideas always comes with a definitive result—everything ultimately has an answer.

​	Alright! This encapsulates my reflections on my recent life. Working in Suzhou is bound to have a significant impact on my future, and it will become a wonderful memory. I have learned and grown a lot here, and I feel more like a knight now than at any previous time. I will also practice my own code of chivalry, raising my knight’s banner towards the dragon, journeying toward the end of this life’s canvas!
