â€‹	**"LIMB KNIGHT"** is a challenging strategy card game. This article will continue from the previous one, providing detailed supplements and explanations about the game's setting. Therefore, it will not exceed the length of the previous article and is intended for those interested in this piece. If you haven't read the previous article, you may want to check out my "LIMB KNIGHT" from October 18, 2024.

Regarding the **"Concentration"** mechanism, represented by a small circle, its most basic use has already been described in the previous article. You can drag it onto yourself or an enemy, and it radiates outward from the center of the circle. For yourself, it increases the evasion rate and damage reduction for your character and surrounding areas. When dragged onto an enemy, it enhances the damage dealt and critical hit rate to that enemy and nearby areas. This basic use is akin to a passive ability. Similar to "Angra Mainyu" in "OVER LORD," **"Concentration"** is not that simple. In the dungeon, you can use **"Concentration"** to drag the circle around to achieve **"danger avoidance."** For example, dragging the circle to the ground increases your chances of avoiding traps, while dragging it into shadows enhances your chances of detecting enemy ambushes. Placing the circle on a chest makes it easier to discover hidden treasures.

The above describes a foundational mechanism of **"Concentration"** in the scene. During combat, **"Concentration"** has more advanced uses beyond basic evasion and damage reduction or enhancement. It also serves as a launching logic for skills similar to those in other games, even for ultimate moves. All **Concentration** skills do not consume additional action sequences but can be incorporated into actions. However, each round, you can only use it once, and using a **Concentration** skill will additionally consume hunger or blood. For instance, the block skill can be activated by placing the circle on yourself, using other **"limbs"** to absorb that portion of damage. Some slashing skills later in the game exist in the form of **"Concentration skills,"** where you can place the circle on an enemy's designated body part to deal damage or place it in other locations, like a chandelier, to drop it on the enemy's head. Other skills, such as fireball spells, can be cast using **"Concentration,"** allowing you to launch a fireball in the direction of the concentration after the next round, dealing damage to the enemy's limbs in that direction. A magical barrier can be generated in the direction of concentration to reflect fireballs.

The above describes the second layer of **"Concentration"** usage, which includes **Concentration skills** and some interactions with the scene. This section will introduce the ultimate use of **"Concentration."** In the later stages, characters may have multiple eyes or special abilities, allowing for multiple points of concentration, but this will consume additional hunger or blood. The number of circles can be less than the current maximum, and you can specify this. Using multiple circles to execute **Concentration skills** can lead to powerful effects. For example, using three circles for a katana's Iaido can connect them into a line, triggering an ultimate Iaido slash that damages the corresponding limbs of the enemy. Of course, you can also use multiple circles without **Concentration skills,** allowing you to significantly enhance damage to enemies or drastically reduce damage to yourself. The effects of multiple concentrations can be terrifying.

Next, let's discuss another key mechanism: the **"Diary."** The **"Diary"** in the game genuinely encourages players to record information, similar to the **"King of Sacred Beasts."** It records what enemies appear to be doing versus what they actually do. You can note in the **"Diary"** the probability of an enemy performing a specific action when they adopt a certain stance. The benefit of this is that when enemies take corresponding stances during combat, you will receive a prompt. This prompt is your diary, and at this moment, your concentration point will automatically jump to the corresponding position, with the **"Battle Record"** stating: "You noticed the enemy's potential stance and took appropriate measures." Since the **"Diary"** is self-recorded, there can be discrepancies, making it very important. It acts as your brain; good record-keeping allows you to master new techniques when acquiring new limbs. The closer the diary's records are to reality, the more proficient you become with that technique. It's worth noting that you can only record enemies in the diary after encountering them, so you can observe enemies first. The **"Diary"** will play a crucial role in the game, especially when pursuing higher difficulty routes later on.

Finally, let's discuss **"Limbs."** The mechanism of **"Limbs"** is quite complex and is still being refined, so this section will only cover what I can currently think of. First, there is limb damage. Limbs have many joints, such as the connection between the arm and hand, the arm and upper body, and the leg and upper body. These connections determine that limb damage is a strategic point. For example, if you sever an arm, the hand will also become useless because they are connected. Similarly, if you bisect the body, the lower half will be rendered completely useless. This is the benefit of flexible attacks; all characters have a **"death point."** If this point is destroyed, the character dies instantly. Generally, humans have two death points: the heart and the head, so other body parts are connected accordingly. **"Limbs"** are supported by other parts, leading to another mechanism called **"Limb Support."** **"Limb Support"** is primarily based on gravity. For instance, if a character is bisected, their entire body will typically fall to the ground due to the lack of support. In the future, gravity magic may be able to alter the force direction acting on a character's **"Limb Support."** For limbs that fall to the ground, you can choose to reattach or consume them during combat to master the skills of that limb or reduce hunger.
