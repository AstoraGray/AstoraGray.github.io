​	After visiting WePlay 2024, I was greatly influenced by the experience. First, I felt the imagination and determination of game developers from around the world. Secondly, it broadened my thinking about game design, particularly in terms of "imagination." Today, I saw a comment under "Stormgate" in the Little Black Box, which stated that micro-management-based War3-type games are no longer suitable for today's players. Indeed, the micro-management in RTS games has been negatively influenced by Blizzard, leading numerous companies to compete on this front, as seen in titles like Red Alert 3 and Empire 4. 

​	Previously, I had conceived a game idea that might even surpass current offerings. In my envisioned game, defeating enemies would require considering factors such as elevation, terrain, gravity, and even the auto-targeting of archers, which wouldn't be directional. This means arrows could potentially be dodged, and players could also manually control them. Shields could actually block attacks, among other mechanics. Essentially, it would integrate elements from Divinity: Original Sin's terrain and Mount & Blade's combat into an RTS format. Upon coming up with this idea, I was incredibly excited and shared it with a friend of mine who is an RTS player. He told me that the mechanics seemed overly complicated. At the time, I was still immersed in my genius concept, but upon deeper reflection, I realized that RTS games have become complex enough as they are; why complicate them further? Reducing micro-management and increasing strategic elements is the way forward for RTS.

​	AlphaGo once defeated Go champion Lee Sedol, but no matter how much it trains, it currently cannot defeat champions in StarCraft. This is because the possibilities in Go can be calculated, albeit a number larger than all particles in the universe, and AI can train to approximate those possibilities. Conversely, the possibilities in StarCraft are virtually infinite and far too complex for AI to handle. So why do I suddenly shift from RTS to Go? Indeed, I now have an idea to combine Go with RTS, and the basic concepts are already forming in my mind. This game won’t require micro-management, boasts far greater possibilities than Go, and broadly falls under the RTS category. I call this game "Sky Base Tigi."

​	Sky Base Tigi is an RTS game based on Go. In the game, players must build bases and manage units each turn to ultimately achieve victory. The victory condition is the same as in Go: to occupy the most territory. Let’s simulate this game: first, the game map corresponds to a Go board. Players start with no resources and must build Sky Base Towers to claim territory. The Sky Base Tower is free, and players can only build one building per turn. Once territory is claimed, surrounding Sky Base Towers begin to generate economic benefits; for example, each turn a Sky Base Tower produces resources for its area. At this point, players can deploy units by constructing barracks, also a building. After placing the barracks, it will automatically generate units each turn facing the direction it is built in, and can use resources to upgrade, producing infantry, cavalry, and more.

​	The basic combat logic is similar to Go: if a building or unit surrounds an opponent’s entity, that part is eliminated, converting it into your territory, which promotes the economic gain from Sky Base Towers and leads to victory. Buildings have varying hit points, and entering an opponent's building deducts their hit points. Combat between units is determined by who acts first, akin to chess, meaning units have a probability of defeating enemy knights. However, unlike chess, units have a movement order and movement range. For example, in my turn, knights have the highest priority, so knights move first followed by infantry. Knights can move two spaces while infantry can move one. All unit types initially face the direction of the barracks, but a very important mechanic comes into play: wall collisions. Wall collisions can occur when a unit reaches the edge of the map, encounters a building, or runs into another unit. After a collision, players can choose to move the unit left or right. This mechanic greatly enhances the strategy of the game, and when combined with the encirclement mechanic, it allows players to defeat enemies unseen.

​	As for future expansions, the game has limitless potential. For instance, I could introduce a building called a conveyor that directly changes a unit’s facing before moving it one space forward, which can only be destroyed by the opponent. Alternatively, I could add a giant cannon that attacks enemies on the same line each turn; if it hits allies, the cannonball could trigger the wall collision mechanism, allowing a choice to move left or right. Cannonballs would adhere to the basic Go principles: if at any moment they, along with buildings and units, surround the opponent, that encircled portion is lost. Or I could introduce a faction like the Undead, represented by a pile of bones that expands each turn in all directions but only has one hit point. I believe this game would have high replayability.

​	Regarding the art style of the game, I envision using Bosch's "The Garden of Earthly Delights" as inspiration, as Sky Base Tigi can encompass all manner of objects and could establish a new category of games.
