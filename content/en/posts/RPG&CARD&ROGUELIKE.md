​	My mind often comes up with many novel game ideas. I love the medieval era, enjoy knights, and am fascinated by sword and magic. The gameplay in my game must be unique. I believe I have directed all my game design talent towards gameplay elements. I excel at proposing particularly special mechanics, while the subsequent detailed designs are gradually inspired during the development process. The ideas I come up with are usually related to the games I have played, such as the inspiration I found in challenging games like "Dark Souls" and "Darkest Dungeon."

I prefer heuristic modular design, which is why there will be many modular components and Eureka moments in this game. I want to use this game to celebrate humanity's exploration of the unknown, after all, humanity’s song is a song of courage!

Ancient texts have described that this world once faced disasters: death, famine, plague, and war. Ultimately, four heroes formed a party to combat these calamities—there was the Mad King from the North, the Sorceress from the East, the Archer Sect from the South, and the Pope from the West. In the end, the disasters were eradicated, but the four heroes disappeared without a trace. Recently, a massive Gothic castle has risen from the ground, absorbing the sunlight around it. Since ancient times, there has been a belief that in times of great evil, heroes blessed by fate will emerge, similar to Jesus, leading the people to vanquish evil! People believe that they must prove their strength to the divine to become the Children of Prophecy. Thus, taking advantage of this calamity, they responded to the king’s call to arms. But with many injured and dead, the ways people met their demise in this disaster instilled fear in later generations. Some even turned into undead. As time passed, fewer and fewer warriors set out to confront the demon castle. The bell tower of the demon castle seemed to be counting down to something ominous. The king had a seer calculate the date of the countdown, which predicted the world's end. Consequently, the kingdom intensified their efforts, and kingdoms across the four directions began to take notice, with brave warriors heading back to the castle to put an end to this malign omen.

This is the basic background setting of the game. The focus then shifts to you, one of the heroes venturing into the fray. Please choose your origin: East, South, West, or North. Different origins determine some of your basic attributes, such as cold resistance, bloodline traits, etc. In this game, players do not have fixed classes. The only classes belong to mercenaries recruited later at the tavern, but as they grow, mercenaries can also learn other skills. Upon dying for the first time in the game, a plot event will trigger, and you will realize that you are the Child of Prophecy. Of course, players first set out as a party of four, but only the player's character survives in the end, marking a plot-driven demise. The initial party configuration includes the player as a swordsman, an archer, a priest, and a spearman. The player starts as a swordsman merely because they wield a sword, not due to any fixed class.

At the beginning of the game, players will be exploring downward because the main entrance of the demon castle is guarded by formidable demons, so they will first navigate the dungeons. The main entrance will become a shortcut in later stages. There are several important mechanics in the game, such as hunger value, which necessitates carrying enough food to venture into the demon castle. Food determines your action points (the characters in this game are gluttons). If you are targeted by a powerful monster without sufficient food, annihilation is inevitable. However, aside from carrying food, if there is a character with high cooking skills in the party, they can stew goblins and the like for sustenance (like a gourmet meal from the labyrinth). In the game, the movement of the four-person party is real-time, but once combat is triggered, it shifts to a turn-based system. Jumping counts as an action and will consume hunger points. After combat is triggered, players can arrange cards and decide their execution order, which also applies to enemies. After confirming the card sequence, clicking start will begin the calculation process. Players cannot control the progress of this calculation, making the strategy in battles critical; the deaths of characters may also be abstract. The arrangement of the card sequence heavily depends on hunger value, and the characters' capacity to endure hunger varies. Longer sequences will generate additional hunger, so you don’t necessarily need to eliminate enemies in one turn—particularly utilizing the traps within the demon castle can also be advantageous.

The game's leveling system allows the party to earn adventure points upon successfully returning, which can be used to enhance certain attributes, with the condition being that your characters must survive; if they die, you start over. As your reputation grows, you can recruit more adventurers and may even encounter other adventurers in the dungeon, though some may be rogue parties specializing in ambushes and loot. I hope you don't cross paths with them. As you progress, you can assign your party to guard areas within the demon castle where you've previously subdued foes and focus on building infrastructure. Another form of leveling up occurs when your character uses a particular skill sequence multiple times, unlocking hidden skills. For example, the swordsman can acquire a combo move after performing upward and downward slashes with a two-handed sword. Combo moves are usually hidden and play a significant role in combat, and these combos can be chained together, which reflects modularity as well as the skill developed through practice. If your teammates perish, the spot where they died will spawn undead and leave behind the items they carried, which you can retrieve, but those items will gradually disappear over time. How do you feel, encountering your former allies as undead?

The game includes a unique mechanic called "limb destruction,” which affects both allies and enemies. If a leg is broken, the character can no longer jump or use certain skills, or using those skills may yield different effects. For instance, if a player with a broken leg tries a jump slash without taking heed, it would only execute the slash without the jump. The best way to kill an enemy is to strike a critical area directly; if that isn’t feasible, try to disable their weapon or the hand holding it. If an orange enemy is shot in the head, unless they are undead, they will die instantly, hence the game may also be quite bloody. You may witness decapitations, dismemberments, and other grisly scenes, but they will be rendered in 2D. When sufficiently hungry, you might even stew your teammate’s hand to eat, though that hand will not grow back. If the party's cohesion is poor, negative effects will arise, such as betrayal, resulting in friendly fire during battles.And the characters in the game have a chance of contracting diseases.

That's about it! I have covered the basic mechanics of the game. This is the game I am quite eager to create, so I’ll stop here for now, leaving the rest to the future!
