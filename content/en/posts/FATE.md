​	Today I moved from a double room in an apartment to a single room and received my passport. Yet for some reason, I'm feeling inexplicably down. I drew a tarot card, and the result was the Fool reversed. Considering what’s happened today, I have a premonition that this day will be a turning point for something important. I need to adjust my mindset and seize the opportunity to face upcoming challenges. Whenever I have a feeling like this, something significant tends to happen, based on past experiences. However, I cannot specify what exactly it is in this article, but it is undoubtedly the most important thing for me.

Following this, I will make the following adjustments: firstly, I will intensify my Japanese studies and accelerate my improvement in the language to seize opportunities. I will work more diligently and innovatively to maximize the chances of success in my entrepreneurship. This is the best opportunity for achieving success. I will also focus on improving my physical fitness and enhancing my brain’s reaction speed. I haven’t been resting well lately, so I need to make sure to go to bed earlier.

Taking these actions will significantly increase my chances of seizing this opportunity and grasping my fate. There is a saying: "to go against the grain." Looking at the three points I listed in the previous paragraph, it's clear that my Japanese skills are currently weak, I lack dedication to my entrepreneurship, and I haven’t been resting properly. At this point, I just need to make a change and do the opposite. I believe I can turn this crisis into an opportunity.
