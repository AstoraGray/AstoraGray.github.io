​	Sometimes, oaths are not fulfilled.

​	A wandering knight followed a writer, pledging to protect him with his sword in order to change the world. However, as winter descended upon the world, he broke this vow, leaving the writer's ideals wounded. The knight comforted him, saying that everything would be better when he woke up tomorrow, that he was still young, and that the journey of creation was not an end but merely the beginning. The knight's journey from swearing an oath to breaking it and then inspiring the writer seemed reasonable but was also extremely hypocritical. He, too, was a dreamer, trapped by reality and becoming the person he once despised; he had once been a small knight.

​	Can a pen change the world? The writer believed that even though he was a minor character, he still had the opportunity to make a difference. He wanted to leave something behind in this world and, through his own efforts, gathered forty-two disciples, intending to create a masterwork with them. Among the disciples were bards, painters, swordsmen, and others, each with different purposes for joining, but ultimately seeking a measure of fame or financial security by following the writer. However, the writer was a gentle and young man, lacking experience, which led the disciples to distance themselves or create carelessly. The works gradually became mediocre.

​	One autumn day, a knight passed by and was invited to participate in the creation. He witnessed the writer's passion and was drawn in by his charisma, choosing to follow him and vowing to protect him with his sword to complete the work. However, upon joining, he discovered that the creations were lackluster, stemming from the disciples' lack of earnestness, so he shattered the work with his sword, declaring he would create something better. The disciples began to drift away, and gradually only the knight and a few other disciples remained by the writer's side. The knight, trapped by dull and rigid tenets, had to practice swordsmanship and uphold the knightly way every day, which slowed the creative process. Nevertheless, the writer still believed the knight could complete the work, placing all hope upon him. He believed this knight was strong, for his status was not low, even if he was a wandering knight.

​	Eventually, the knight lost enthusiasm over day after day of creation. He gazed at the distant mountains, reminiscing about the battles of his past, and his heart was no longer in it. He began to live a life of indifference, carelessly addressing the writer's requests, and the project once again seemed far off.

​	One day, the writer invited the knight to his home for a meal, to thank him for his protection, but the knight, feeling guilty, declined.

​	One day, the writer inquired about the progress of the work. The knight replied that it was still early but not difficult; it could be realized with a bit more time.

​	One day, the writer asked again about the progress, and the knight told him to find another knight to create the work. It was very sudden, but the writer had anticipated this; he had seen the knight's indifference. He smiled, but all that remained was anger and a shattered work. The knight encouraged the writer to persist until a work capable of changing the world was created. The knight had broken his oath, yet he was comforting him. Was this knight hypocritical? Perhaps, but why did he vow in the first place?
