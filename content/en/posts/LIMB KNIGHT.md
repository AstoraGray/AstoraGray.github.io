​	Hunger is an innate fear common to all living beings. One day, a powerful teleportation spell transported a beautiful continent into a labyrinth. As one of the princess's attendants, you vowed to find her within the maze. However, the labyrinth is fraught with danger, and many monsters have mutated. You are lacking food, and the threat of starvation looms over you. While you make your way through the labyrinth, you encounter a girl who is about to be devoured by a beast. She looks at you with pleading eyes, presenting you with two choices: save her or not. As a knight, you desperately want to save her, but you also wish to conserve your strength to find the princess. (If the player chooses to save her, they will be killed by the beast, leading to a bad ending.) You decide to watch from the sidelines, as the beast swiftly devours the girl's head and leaves only her severed limbs behind. However, it notices you on its way out, seemingly satisfied after its meal. 

​	You witness an unprecedented scene: the dim corridor, the girl's remains, and the beast. Looking at the remains, your stomach suddenly growls. You, the attendant of the princess, have become so hungry that you feel an urge to eat human flesh. You touch your stomach, feelings of surprise and fear wash over you. How could a noble knight sink to this level? At this moment, two options appear: eat the girl's remains or bury her. (If the player chooses to bury the girl, they retain their humanity, and the game shifts to a harder difficulty route.) Ultimately, your hunger drives you to survive; you consume the girl's remains and keep the rest for future sustenance.

​	This is the first tutorial process and storyline of the game, introducing players to the mechanics of limb destruction and hunger levels. The game then continues. Although you are an attendant, you lack combat experience. Inside your backpack is a diary that records basic combat strategies, which you memorize to analyze your enemies' techniques. After consuming the girl's remains, your hunger level decreases, allowing you to take more actions in a turn. As you navigate the labyrinth, you encounter your first humanoid enemy, who appears to be a guard of the kingdom. He has lost his sanity due to starvation and charges at you, desperate for survival. 

​	The battle begins: the attendant raises his short sword, preparing for a downward strike. Based on your analysis, you deduce that this guardsman uses the Northern God Style swordsmanship. His elevated strike likely aims for a decapitation (80% chance) while a feint attack at the legs has a small probability (20%). You focus your attention on his head since a strike there would mean instant death, planning to thrust upward to sever the guard's hands. However, this guard, underestimating you, targets your head, attempting to deliver a fatal blow. The fight starts! The enemy charges at you, aiming for your head, but you lean your body back as you raise your sword, cutting off the guard's hands. He falls to the ground, losing his ability to fight, bleeding profusely and facing certain death if the bleeding is not stopped.

​	This describes the battle mechanics of the game. The gameplay utilizes a turn-based card game system, yet differs from other card games. You must choose your sequence of actions before each round begins, with action limits tied to your hunger level and health. The action sequence I chose was Fool's Style - Side Step - Upward Thrust, while the enemy chose Striking Stance - Downward Slash. I acted three times while the enemy acted twice. There's also a focus mechanic, represented by a small circle, which you can position on yourself to enhance your surrounding defense and evasion or on the enemy to execute a risky attack that improves your chance of hitting and dealing damage to that designated area. You can infer the enemy's stance from pre-battle investigations, including but not limited to tracking, diary notes, and probing. You can record your findings in the diary, calculating the probabilities of specific attacks corresponding to the enemy’s stance. Eventually, you can defeat enemies without taking damage. As you become more familiar with your opponents, you can focus on their weapon-holding hands, allowing you to execute deflective moves that maximize damage. However, beasts require greater insight and intuition, as their attacks often differ from sword techniques, with axes and polearms presenting different challenges.

​	Having defeated the enemy, your kind nature compels you to spare his life. Just as you prepare to leave, you feel a chill run down your back. You turn around to find the dying guard, clutching a sword in his mouth, attempting to stab your abdomen. You stagger to the ground, and he severs your right hand with his sword. As you near death, your instinct to survive overwhelms all else. With every ounce of strength, you behead the guard. As you look upon this scene, a pitiful laugh escapes you, filled with despair for this world, overwhelmed by endless pain. Seeing your severed hand, an ingenious idea strikes you: you could attach the guard's hand to your own. You recall hearing somewhere that chimeras are created through limb grafting, acting as the apostles of the god of limb attachment. You bravely attempt it, and to your astonishment, your hand begins to move, skillfully utilizing the guard's techniques. You can accomplish this due to your brain's understanding of swordsmanship combined with the guard's proficiency, creating a perfect union. Your understanding stems from the notes in your diary.

​	This introduces another system, limb grafting, which is a central gameplay mechanic. Just like in games with a ring system, limb grafting in this game is also logical and enables the character to acquire new skills (claws, hands, dragon heads), new resources (hearts, batteries, crystals), with flesh powered by blood while mechanics use electric power. Almost every part of your body, except for your brain, can be grafted. Grafting consumes your health, and while the health of limbs indicates their wear, you have a total health pool directly linked to your strength. The more health you have, the more limbs you can graft. Therefore, there is no health limit in this game, but as a fleshy being, severed limbs will bleed.

​	This concludes the bulk of this game proposal. This is my first time presenting a planning proposal through a narrative background, and while it may seem unclear in focus, it effectively conveys the concept. While writing these words, I was also simulating the game's actual operation in my mind. The game features a 3D retro pixel art style for environments and a 2D display for characters, with controls for movement in all directions. This concept is truly exciting; the interplay between different gameplay mechanics creates a unique chemistry, and with future support for a creative workshop, it will elevate the game's experience to limitless heights.
