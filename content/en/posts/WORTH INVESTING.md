```C#
// The personal value in this aspect = current value * time invested (in percentage of days) * talent, but will not exceed talent * 10000, which is the upper limit
private float GetYourValue(float learnDay, float talent) => Math.Clamp(curValue * (1 + learnDay / 100) * talent, talent, talent * 10000);
// The value obtained from the investment = time spent (in days) * personal value in this direction + money (Rmb)
private float GetInvestValue(float timeDay, float moneyRmb) => timeDay * GetYourValue(learnDay, talent) + moneyRmb;
```

As I live longer in this world, I increasingly feel that this world is like a game. While writing this article, I have already lived on this blue planet for 8702 days. After going out to clear my mind during the National Day holiday, I suddenly thought that the so-called investment should not be limited to financial aspects. If we elevate it to the level of paying for life, it becomes very interesting.

If we look at the world through the formula I provided above, it seems that life is essentially a game. Therefore, in the following content, I will not limit myself to personal views; instead, I will detach my soul and think from a higher perspective, considering how to invest in our own lives while demonstrating the correctness of the above formula.

From the moment a person is born, basic points are already set. Spiritual points include artistic talent, technical abilities, intuition, etc., while material points consist of money, houses, birthplace, etc. The growth of spiritual abilities is usually in percentages, such as 1%, 2%, or 5%. The growth of material aspects follows the formula I provided earlier, which combines the time invested and personal value in that area, along with the money invested. 

It is not difficult to see from the formula that the best way to enhance the final investment value is to first improve one’s own value in that area. For instance, if I want to create an outstanding project that brings me far greater benefits than my current income, I must first enhance my value in that area—this includes my cognitive level, skills, and connections. Then, by investing time and money, I can successfully execute my plans. 

In gaming terms, this means leveling up my attributes, teaming up with friends to tackle challenges, and understanding strategies before embarking on an adventure. Once everything is prepared, I can complete the challenge with minimal time and resources while achieving a high score. Thus, time is interconnected with all things; fundamental principles apply across different dimensions. Investing in life is a meaningful endeavor. Being still young, I will practice this formula by prioritizing the enhancement of my own value, aiming to excel in this so-called Earth Online.

Today, I wrote about a rather unique topic. It may seem that I am not quite normal, but I enjoy viewing life as a game. After all, it is possible that our world is simulated, which presents a paradox. Until we can simulate a world, we can never definitively conclude whether our world is virtual. Therefore, I choose to believe.
