Welcome to GRAY CORE, my fantasy world. I'm AstoraGray, an indie game developer dreaming of creating a game that simulates the real world. I have a particular interest in nuclear elements, and I’ll be sharing some of my technical experiences and gaming insights on this blog, along with some pretty wild content, heh. Anyway, I’ll keep updating this blog to prove my existence and share the skills I’ve learned. If you have any feedback on my articles, feel free to message me or leave a comment below! owo
