In the eternal chaos, amidst the vast dust, 

Two particles collide, giving birth to a world. 

All things return to calm, and causality begins to sprout, 

A life form emerges, proclaiming the existence of all. 

From then on, there is Eden, the mortal realm, and purgatory. 

Eden is the root of all that is beautiful, 

The mortal realm is filled with desires and sins, 

Purgatory speaks of pain, lamenting the anguish of being sawn apart. 

Who knows how many years later, a king seeks eternal life, 

In the golden land, Didos I, 

Wise men gather, intending to seal off purgatory and Eden, 

Mortal bodies challenge the gods for the first time, 

The people suffer, amidst mountains of corpses and seas of blood, 

In darkness without light, the mortal purgatory unfolds, 

One life departs, transformed into a demon, 

Though seeking eternal life, it becomes inhuman, 

Piercing, blood sacrifices, cannibalism, breeding. 

All for the sake of attaining true eternal life, 

A dark church rises, dwelling in the mad palace. 

Hunger and fear shroud the world, 

A boy who has lost his memory embarks on a journey, 

Determined to cut off the head of the new god, returning to the source of the old god, 

Concentrating on a weakness, slaying a hundred demons invisibly, 

The boy's eyes blaze with anger as he confronts Didos I, 

Didos sends forth his second generation; the second sends forth the third, 

Until the sixteenth generation, he unleashes the Chimera, 

The Chimera has three heads, symbolizing power, slaughter, and desire, 

One head is severed, the scepter loses its luster, 

The second head is pierced, and flowers of the other shore begin to grow on the marble floor, 

The third head is cleaved in two, the desire for eternal life is forever unattainable, 

The boy beheads the new god, and the world returns to its origin, 

Everything feels so normal, as if nothing ever happened, 

The head of Didos I is cast into the void, resentment becoming a devourer, 

He devours this world, 

The anger in the boy's eyes cannot be contained, turning into a holy spear, 

The void and light, chaos and order, 

The great path obliterated, all things suffer, 

Once again, they enter the eternal chaos, 

An old man with white hair wrote thus on parchment, 

Curtain call!
