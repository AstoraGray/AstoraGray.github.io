​	I am a knight, holding onto pure ideals, but trapped in reality. Idealists are like firewood, standing on the earth's crust, ignited by the burning heat of ideals, illuminating the entire history of humanity with fireworks. Idealists are indeed a significant driving force behind the increase of entropy in this world. However, I know that if I become a complete idealist, I am destined to sacrifice. I do not possess extraordinary talent that would allow me to directly become a comet like an idealist, but before that, I will become an extreme realist, a small asteroid that can illuminate the surroundings, even if the only light comes from a campfire lit by human hands, or if it is dim and without light.

​	My personality has been primarily influenced by the following individuals, who are my mentors. Professor Ryuichi Sakamoto has strengthened my spiritual world, allowing me to perceive the present world with a detached feeling, regardless of joy or sorrow. His music continuously heals me, enabling my heart to remain calm like still water. Chui Ge, an independent game developer, has created extraordinary works like "The Witness" and "The Talos Principle," broadening my perspective as both a player and a game developer. Chui Ge's heuristic game design philosophy will accompany me on my future game development journey. A great game allows players to intuitively grasp the rules and piece together a new universal key to unlock originally fixed locks. Amazarashi's Akita Uncle, whose music strikes at my soul, gives me the motivation to live during the darkest times of my life with his determination to live after despair. My personality is destined to be somewhat melancholic, much like allocating points in an RPG game; I am currently exploring the direction in which my points have been allocated. At least I am someone who easily falls into internal conflict and deep contemplation. Akita Uncle's songs have taught me the ability to resolve these emotions, changing the trajectory of my life. 

​	ACA, whose voice I greatly admire, resonated with me deeply when I first heard her sing. Her image overlaps with that of someone I admire, and the quality of ACA's songs is exceptionally high. She feels like an existence I cannot reach, just like the person I admire in reality, who is also difficult to touch. This feeling is persistent and often reminds me in my dreams that I should continue to move forward and become a better person. Although this emotional connection may seem strange, I believe that existence is reasonable, and the threads of fate will eventually intertwine. I will witness some outcome, whether good or bad.

Thanks to Github.io, I can preserve my thoughts without fear of being attacked or shut down due to unpaid fees. It will exist forever, in the coming decades or even centuries. Even if I have turned to ashes, this article will still exist, right? It has transcended the dimensions of time.
