```DeadCode
Current Status of Indie Game Development
Day 1: Wow, this idea is so cool! I need to write it down.
Day 2: Damn, what I wrote last time isn't enough. I need to add more; this game is really awesome!
Day 3: Show it to the artist. Artist: Wow, interesting! I can work in this style.
Day 4: Start looking for various references and create a new Unity folder to prepare for development.
Day 5: Developing an indie game takes a lot of time. Maybe I should just give up.

​	My situation is similar to the above: I think of a great idea and then abandon it, reasoning that it will disrupt my current plans. I was thinking this way a few days ago. But today, while walking on the cold streets at night, I suddenly felt an unexpected chill and a very uncomfortable emotion. I've always wanted to change something. In the past, I would try to make changes, but now I seem to be settling for the status quo. This isn't like me; I admit I've fallen into the vortex of nihilism once again, feeling as if a thick barrier surrounds my brain. 

​	Right now, I am being overly rational, which makes me feel extremely repressed. What I truly crave is a sense of madness. My answer is to seek change. I will center my plans around ensuring Limb Knight progresses smoothly. The fact that this idea found me before I went to sleep is an opportunity, and writing it down as an article is fate; it is destined to remain indelible in my mind. Afterwards, I will challenge the triad of work, study, and indie game development. I want all these plans, at least until I exhaust myself. This is the idealist's struggle and rebellion against reality.
