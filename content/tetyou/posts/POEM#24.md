A calm and wonderful year, reflecting the sun's brilliance like the autumn lake.

This year has been more peaceful than any previous year, as I have mostly lived alone since graduating from university. I have had plenty of time to reflect and meditate, enriching my inner world. On the timeline and within novels, I play a transitional role; before the decisive moments arrive, there is calmness, a long stretch without results. Living alone for an extended period inevitably leads to feelings of depression. I once wrote two passages on a cold night while walking home to the subway station.

Life is like a whirlpool, and all I can do is be swept into it, waiting for the exit to arrive.

For a while, I found myself caught in a whirlpool due to the conflicts between solo travel, work, and studying Japanese. Day after day, it felt as if I were forever trapped on the 8th floor, unable to ascend to the 9th or descend to the 7th. Every time I visited the rice noodle shop downstairs, the owner treated me like a new customer, introducing the menu, even though I had been there many times. This only deepened my sense of being stuck in a daily loop. Eventually, I reconciled with myself; I could travel alone later and find other activities to engage in, like playing games or photography.

There is a devil in my heart that rots me, yet as I write this, I feel like a knight.

Everyone has duality—light and dark. Prolonged solitude can lead to subconscious negative and evil thoughts. In my view, complete solitude amplifies both positive and negative thoughts. When I first began living alone, my heart was tumultuous, reaching a low point. Looking back, if I hadn't overcome that low point, I wouldn't be in my current state of mind. Now, my heart is as calm as a still lake, and I believe that meditation and blogging have saved me.

Knights and waste, the spiritual world is a continuation of the real world, while the real world is the conclusion of the spiritual world.

Here, I quote a line from "EVA": dreams are a continuation of reality, and reality is the end of dreams. In my spiritual world, I always imagine myself as a knight, yet I am trapped by reality. I see myself as a waste; I have lofty ideals but struggle to pave a feasible path. Ideals and fantasies coexist in my mind like quantum superposition, while nihilism also troubles me. However, writing this article signifies that I have temporarily triumphed over them. I have found a viable path and discovered the meaning of life. When I took the first step, I realized it wasn't so difficult; the rest is just about persevering to the end.

Much of what I've said contains negative emotions, but this year has truly been remarkable. It was the first year I genuinely explored the world, filled with many events. In spring, I experienced job hunting; in summer, I worked at a gaming company in Chengdu; in autumn and winter, I worked in Suzhou, meeting many companions along the way. I also learned photography and some Japanese. I went through a low point while working at the gaming company, feeling shaken by the PUA tactics and the production of low-quality mobile games, as if life had no end in sight. However, coincidentally, during training in Xiamen, I saw a job description and met my current colleagues Richard and LuYao, who changed the course of my life. I am very grateful to them. This reminds me of the time I went to Qingyang Palace in Chengdu with a close friend to draw lots. I drew a favorable lot, and the Taoist priest said my work might not go smoothly now, but if I encountered a benefactor in the second half of the year, I would surely succeed. Looking back, he was right, but the underlying truth is about seeking change. When life becomes unsatisfactory, it's essential to try to make a change; opportunities often arise at such moments.

Here are a few memorable lessons from this year:  
1. Work and ideals need to be separated. I once doubted this and ended up in a low-quality gaming company, which left me feeling defeated. Ideals are personal and subjective, so one cannot rely on others to achieve them; it must come from oneself.  
2. Persistence in any endeavor will yield results. Learning Japanese has brought me great satisfaction because I stuck with it; I currently know nearly 1,300 words—slow but effective.  
3. When life spirals, timely change can lead to breakthroughs. This is based on my personal experience and is very useful, so I included it here.  
4. Blogging is a meaningful activity; it not only proves that I am alive but also prompts me to question my own soul. Hooray!

Now, let's talk about real-life events:  
5. I learned film photography, which is very interesting and gives me another reason to go out.  
6. The VisionPro project I led, "Chatwo," has been launched on the Apple Store, and the development process has been streamlined, which feels great.  
7. My Japanese has improved significantly, which is excellent, and the path ahead is clearer.

I have a feeling that next year will be even more exciting than this one. Now, let's move on to the summary interface.
